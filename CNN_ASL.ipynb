Each column (except 'label') is a pixel values, no RGB values, thus the image is stored in black and white color (grayscale). For visual representation of the data, please see recollected image from CSV pixel values down below, once the dataset is imported. In addition to that, we have 'label' column that has numbers that symbolize alphabet letters accordingly: 0=A, 1=B, etc. Note: Letter 'J' and 'Z' not included, b/c they are shown as moving gestures, thus not suitable for dataset."
