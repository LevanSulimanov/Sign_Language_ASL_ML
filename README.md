# Sign_Language_ASL_ML
Project aim is to create a classifier to detect ASL gestures and link them with alphabet letters

classifier_analysis.ipynb file contains various approaches towards solving this problem, but as expected CNN takes the first place. It is also interesting to take a look at SVM results and how One Versus All(Rest) strategy provides very good results.

Please remember to extract "sign-language-mnist" zip-file, in order to be able to run provided models.
